| --- | ------------------------                                           | -----        |
| MOV | Take the contents of one location in memory and move it to another | MOV LEFT ACC |
| INC | Increases the value of the ACC register by one                     | INC          |
| SWP | Swap the values of ACC to BAK                                      | SWP          |
| ADD | Add                                                                | ADD LEFT     |
